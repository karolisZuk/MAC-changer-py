#MAC Spoofer

M1 Mac compatible MAC address spoofer written in Python. MAC address has to be mac compatible (see what I did there?).

[miniwebtool](https://miniwebtool.com/mac-address-generator/) seem to be working most of the times, with lower case letters, numbers, and dashes. For example: aa-bb-cc-dd-ee-ff.
